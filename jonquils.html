                    <h2>Personal Review</h2>
                    <p>If you are looking for a cute cafe with great desserts, this is the place for you: Jonquils Cafe. The shop itself is very well oriented and is very aesthetically pleasing. I found a lot of students chose this place as a spot for studying since it is pretty quiet with nice music and most of the tables are for 1-2 people. I found this cafe on Google Maps and was first surprised by how pretty their cakes look and when I got there, I had a rose latte with their Geometric Apple cake and it was like no other cake I have ever had before. Even my friend who doesnâ€™t like sweets as much was amazed by not only the presentation of the dessert but the flavor as well.</p>
