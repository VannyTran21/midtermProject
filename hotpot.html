                    <h2>Personal Review</h2>
                    <p>Out of all the restaurants I tried during this trip, Happy Lamb Hot Pot is definitely my favorite. This is a chain of restaurants that was first opened in Boston, specializes in Chinese hot pot and is known for their signature divided pot (meaning that you can have 2 different types of broth at the same time!). It was my first time trying this so I of course had to choose the divided pot and it was absolutely delicious and worth it. The broth was very light and not overpowering with spices and the meat was so tender. I would strongly recommend you try this place since the price is fairly cheap for its high quality and amazing food. I will definitely come</p>
