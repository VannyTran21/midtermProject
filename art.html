                    <h2>Personal Review</h2>
                    <p>If you are an art lover, this is one of the must visit locations while you're in Boston - The Museum of Fine Arts. Ranked as the 20th largest art museum in the world, this museum contains nearly half a million works of art that are displayed throughout the 4 levels building. It will take you a good while to go through every piece of art here. Their collections are abundant, ranging from ancient Rome, Greece and Egypt Art to contemporary art from several different cultures all around the world. It’s hard to choose which art piece was the most impressive, but if I have to recommend one for you to see, it has to be the marble sculpture of the goddess Juno. Standing tall and beautifully in one of the galleries, the statue is at a remarkable height of 13-foot (that is almost 4 meters tall). And because of its size, they had to airlift it into the gallery through an opening on the roof. I only got to spend about 2 and half hours since it was close to closing time when I got there so I didn’t have the chance to look at every corner of it, but I sure did have a wonderful time being completely lost in the beauty of the masterpieces and how ginormous this museum is. If you plan to see each and every piece of art work here, I recommend that you leave a 3-4 hours time window for your visit.
