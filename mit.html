                    <h2>Personal Review</h2>
                    <p>Another famous I.V.Y. League school in the area: Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As said in its name, the school is known for its top computing program in the country and in the world (placed second in National Universities). People who got into this school are full of pride as the acceptance rate is very low (only 4.1%). The school has many notable alumni such as Sal Khan, Jonah Peretti, Ronald Erwim McNair, Drew Houston, Glen Ellison, Seo Dong-Joo, and many others. I had my visit after the official hours of the university so didn’t get quite as much touring around since many buildings were locked. One of the things I was impressed with was the laboratories that all look so modern and especially spotlessly clean. The display by the windows in the engineering hall was also interesting since visitors have the chance to see how smart and creative MIT students can be with their creations. One of the halls has an ancient design with massive pillars that make you feel like you are entering a museum instead of a technology institute and I found that was very memorable as well. Another thing that I’ve never seen at other schools is vending machines that sell electronic supplies such as iphone adapters, ethernet cords, or even masks. If you have a chance to visit this school, definitely find this vending machine because it is nothing like any other colleges.</p>
