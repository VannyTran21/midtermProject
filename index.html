            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my adventure in Boston, Massachusetts! As a full-time student, I have limited time for traveling. However, that doesn’t stop me from exploring and learning about new places when I have a chance to. My interest in traveling sparked when I left my hometown Vietnam to come to the U.S. for further education. It all started here when I realized how much of a difference the U.S. is compared to what I learned about from the Internet or from friends that have been living there. I realized that one could never fully experience a place unless they actually stepped foot there. Since then, I decided that whenever time is allowed, I will visit as many new places as I possibly can.

                In the new year of 2023, I decided to visit Boston, Massachusetts for it had always been on my bucket list. I had such a wonderful time there and I absolutely loved every second of it. As known to be the most educated state in the United States, Boston has many famous universities that I couldn’t miss, prominently Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Talking about attractions, there are hundreds in this city to visit but I only had a few days here so I’m going to introduce you to the ones I visited, which includes New England Aquarium, Museum of Arts, Salem Witch Museum, and Faneuil Hall Marketplace. And the food, it is amazing; I have a few places that are the highlight of this trip and I want to share them with you. So follow me and explore a corner of Boston, Massachusetts.
