                    <h2>Personal Review</h2>
                    <p>Here comes one of the world famous I.V.Y. League schools: Harvard University. Everyone can hardly forget this name since it has been known as the top school of the world (recently placed at number 4 worldwide). The university is known for its competitive process of getting accepted (only 3% of acceptance rate), so it is a pride for many people when they are accepted to the school’s programs. It is also known for having several successful and world famous alumni such as George Washington Bush, John F. Kennedy, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Helen Keller, Henry David Thoreau, Matt Damon, Ben Shapiro, and the list goes on. There is also a statue of John Harvard nicknamed as the “statue of three lies” outside of the university hall which is known as the third most well-known and photographed statue in the U.S. I had a chance to see this statue and also noticed that most visitors would be willing to wait in long lines to take photos with this statue and touch the left shoe of it for good luck and success. If you have a chance to visit this university, take a look at this statue and see that the left shoe is much shinier than the rest of it since there have been so many people who touched it for good luck.</p>
